                                showers that water the earth." During this rotation you will learn how to plant and
                                maintain different types and sizes of lawns. Lawn management requires diligence and hard
                                work; traits that any successful minister must have. The rotation is designed to help
                                develop these traits so as to prepare you for the hard work and diligent effort that
                                ministry work demands.</p>

                                must be blameless and given to hospitality and under this rotation, you will learn how
                                to take care of guests. This rotation is especially important for ladies who could be
                                pastors' wives and would need to know how to host a number of guests at the same time.
                                Developing a good hospitality ministry will endear people to your church and contribute
                                significantly to the image of your ministry.</p>

                                houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them:" It is the
                                Chancellor's vision that ministries should be able to sustain themselves without a heavy
                                reliance on external support, and this school is no different. In this innovative
                                sub-rotation called the Plantation and Bible Memorization Sub-rotation, you will be
                                involved in planting and tending different types of food crops, such as plantain, lemon,
                                orange and banana. We also have a vegetable plantation.</p>

                                be introduced to the basics of building. In the Chancellor's bestselling book, The Good
                                General he talks about how a pastor must fight by building. Building will also establish
                                your church and give your church a permanent presence wherever you are. Many people
                                don't build because it is difficult, expensive and involves a long fight. Pastors must
                                not be afraid to build. This rotation will help you overcome that obstacle. Isaiah
                                65:21. Says And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and plant vineyards and eat
                                the fruit of them. That will be your story!</p>

                                helps all those who go through it to learn the rudiments of what housekeeping entails.
                                You will also learn how to maintain a whole house, a guest room or a dormitory. After
                                this sub-rotation, no type of ministry work will be above or below you to engage in.</p>

                                involves being exposed to the technical part of running the campus. A pastor who seeks
                                to have a large ministry must not be ignorant of all the complexities of facility
                                management. You will gain an in-depth understanding of water systems, waste disposal,
                                power management and many more skills under this sub-rotation.</p>

                                This alludes to the importance and need for constant security in an institution. This
                                rotation will train you to be observant, to think on your feet, and the value of
                                communicating in a timely manner. These are qualities that any minister needs, whether
                                it is on the mission field or in your local church. May your eyes be open to see what
                                others don't see and to notice what others don't notice during this rotation!</p>
