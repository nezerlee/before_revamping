                                In actual application, the work spans from organizing students to establish
                                churches on the Akwuapem-Mampong Ridge, monitoring their work and
                                controlling pastoral events that ensure the success of their pastoral

                                The SSMG comprises of 32 campaigns that work simultaneously, to practically
                                equip students with church administration, church growth and Sunday

                                In addition, the office assesses the work of each student under SSMG. The
                                "PASTORAL POINT SYSTEM" is used to score students. To qualify to be
                                appointed as a pastor one needs a minimum of 700 points.</p>
