                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Anagkazo Bible & Ministry Training Centre (ABMTC) was founded in 1996 by the Presiding
                        Bishop of
                        the Lighthouse Chapel International Denomination; Bishop Dag Heward-Mills. This was prompted by
                        Bishop Dag's strong desire to see young men and women trained and equipped for the work of the
                        ministry, according to Ephesians 4:11-12. It is the founder's greatest desire that the school
                        would
                        always remain a pastors' training school, without ever evolving into a secular institution
                        whether
                        partly or fully.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Anagkazo started as a one-year part-time bible school. The first graduation came on in November
                        1997
                        with 12 students. It then later evolved into a two-year full-time program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on the conviction that ministers must have adequate training in different aspects of
                        ministry,
                        a decision was taken during the 2006 academic year to extend the period of training to four
                        years.
                        At this point, the school was called; Christ Missions Academy, later being changed back to
                        Anagkazo
                        Bible & Ministry Training Centre.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The word 'anagkazo' is the Greek word for compel (Luke 14:23). Our students are trained to
                        compel,
                        necessitate, entreat and constrain the unsaved to enter into the kingdom of God.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first batch of 45 students for the four-year program graduated in November 2008. In November
                        2009, another batch of 67 students were graduated from the institution. Over the years, Anagkazo
                        Bible School, which is now well recognized has become an international ground for pastoral and
                        missionary training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, Anagkazo has over 800 full-time residential students. After much fine-tuning, the
                        full scope of training offered by the school currently spans three years
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our students come from Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Carribbean, and more. Graduates of
                        Anagkazo are known for their soul-winning and church-planting passion, and have a strong desire
                        to
                        see the gospel preached to every soul everywhere! Their life's aim is to see every soul
                        'anagkazoed'
                        into the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coming to Anagkazo would definitely help you to nurture and fulfil God's calling upon your life.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Anagkazo Campus</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Anagkazo campus is a place dedicated to the training of men and women for the
                        perfecting of the saints for the work of ministry, and for the edifying of the body of
                        Christ.
                        This facility is solely dedicated to the propagation
                        of the gospel through the preaching of the word of God, the planting of churches, the
                        conducting
                        of open-air crusades, the conducting of Christian conferences and camps,
                        the publishing of Christian literature and the teaching of the work of the ministry of Jesus
                        Christ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This campus was not built for the propagation and the study of theology that is
                        traditionally taught in secular universities and other accredited institutions.
                        This campus was not intended to become a centre to analyze and question the authenticity of
                        God's Word.
                        This campus was not built to analyze, discuss, question or even receive the two hundred or
                        more
                        other opinions and theories about God that the great theologians of our world have.
                        This campus was not built to teach or present the various schools of thought about ministry
                        that
                        exist today.
                        This campus was not built to satisfy the requirements of a secular or tertiary education
                        institution.
                        This campus was not built to acquire approval or accreditation from secular accrediting
                        authorities.
                        This campus was not built to help men to question their faith in God.
                        This campus was not built to quench the fire and zeal of God in men.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The founders of the Anagkazo Bible & Ministry Training Centre believe in the whole Bible and
                        believe that many are called, and that many have the ministry of a shepherd.
                        The founders believe in the anointing of the Holy Spirit,
                        the supernatural gifts of ministry, miracles, signs and wonders, speaking in tongues,
                        casting out devils, sending out of missionaries, the art of leadership, the art of
                        following,
                        the art of hearing, the art of ministry, power evangelism, soul winning,
                        sacrifice, church growth, mega churches, church planting, teachings on loyalty and
                        disloyalty,
                        faith, prayer and the art of being led by the Holy Spirit.

                        The founders of Anagkazo are aware that this school embodies a unique line of teaching
                        which may not be commonly available everywhere.
                        However, this campus was built to shamelessly teach and publish
                        these truths about God and the work of ministry in a systematic and biblical way.
